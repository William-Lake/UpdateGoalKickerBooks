# UpdateGoalKickerBooks
A small Python utility program for updating [GoalKicker books](https://goalkicker.com/) in a given directory to the most recent version.

Compiled to an .exe thanks to [Brent Vollebregt](https://github.com/brentvollebregt)'s awesome [auto-py-to-exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe) project. Thanks Brent!

## Usage

1. Place the .exe or python file in the directory containing your GoalKicker books.
2. Run the program

If you're using the .exe, double click it.

If you're using the python file, open a terminal in the directory and run:
```python
python UpdateBooks.py
```
3. The GoalKicker books will now be updated. Those that need to be updated will be replaced.
